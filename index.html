But don’t try to memorize it. If you try to memorize it, what happens when you’re presenting and you forget what you were going to say? You’ll stumble and become even more nervous. Trying to memorize a presentation word for word is a mistake. If your presentation sounds memorized, it would come across as authentically. It will sound like it’s coming from your head instead of your heart.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="97"><p data-reactid="98">Remember the last time you took a vacation? What happened when you came back to work and people asked you about your vacation?</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="99"><p data-reactid="100">You didn’t have to think about what to say because you just drew on your experience. When the next person asked you about your vacation, you told them pretty much the same story. Maybe you left something out that you told the first person that wasn’t that interesting, or you added a little story about something fun that you forgot, or you embellished a little bit.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="101"><p data-reactid="102">By the time you tell the third person, you’re telling pretty much the same story. You may even be using some of the same words or phrases.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="103"><p data-reactid="104">By the time you tell the fourth person or the fifth, the story is rolling off your tongue. You’re not thinking about it, but it’s pretty much the same story with your favorite phrases. You’re not forgetting to talk about anything you think is interesting and it’s sounding like you’re telling the story for the first time. You’ve memorized it without memorizing it and it’s coming from your heart, not your head.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="105"><p data-reactid="106">But here’s the trick: you can’t tell the story without first having the experience.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="107"><p data-reactid="108">So what’s the experience? What if you’re presenting from a PowerPoint deck?</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="109"><p data-reactid="110">You have to go on vacation. You have to go through the deck, through each slide, and have the experience. You have to find your path through each slide.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="111"><p data-reactid="112">Take your presentation and print out the slides. Then draw a 1 with a circle around it on your first point on the slide, then a line to the second point (draw a 2 with a circle around that), then a line to the third point, if you have one (and number that one). If you have more than three things to highlight on the slide, redesign the slide. A slide should actually only make one point, but you might have two or three highlights.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="113"><p data-reactid="114">Now you know the path through the slide, explain it as simply as you can. Go through the slide several times. Each time you go through it, try telling the story in a slightly different way. Eventually, you’ll find the way of saying it that sounds right—captures your key points and makes them in a compelling way—and, just as importantly, feels right. When you say the words, they flow from you’re mouth. You’re not working against yourself.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="115"><p data-reactid="116">If you’re rehearsing your presentation and you keep stumbling over the same words or phrases, you’re working against yourself. Find a different way to express your point. Keep practicing until it feels right.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="117"><p data-reactid="118">When things feel right, you’ll feel more confident. And confidence is courage.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="119"><p data-reactid="120">Once you’ve taken the vacation through your slides, know the outline and the essence. First we went here and then we went there. This was the takeaway here and this was the takeaway there.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="121"><p data-reactid="122">Having said all of the above, there are actually two things you do want to memorize word-for-word: your opening and your closing.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="123"><p data-reactid="124">Why?</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="125"><p data-reactid="126">You have to understand the way your audience’s attention will fluctuate during your presentation. You’ll have their attention at the beginning because they don’t yet know what you’re going to say. They’ll perk up to see whether or not you’re worth paying attention to. And they’ll perk up at the end of your presentation, too, because when you’re done it’s probably time to go to lunch or to go home or to the next meeting.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="127"><p data-reactid="128">If you’re nervous when you start, you’ll likely stumble out of the gate and that will just make you more nervous. And you’ll probably be so relieved when your presentation is almost over that you’ll botch the close. If your presentation is a pitch, you won’t be confident when you make your ask, or you’ll forget to make your ask at all.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="129"><p data-reactid="130">Manage your instrument.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="131"><p data-reactid="132">Actors talk about their body and their voice as their instrument. I’m not suggesting that you act when you present—actually, I recommend the exact opposite—but you need to think about your body and your voice in the same way. Aside from your slides, it’s all you’ve got to work with.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="133"><p data-reactid="134">You’re nervous when you first start to present because you’ve got one foot on the gas and one foot on the brakes. You’re not scared, you’re excited. You have all this anticipation, all this energy, and it has no where to go. You have to give it somewhere to go. You have to let it move.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="135"><p data-reactid="136">How do you move it?</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="137"><p data-reactid="138">You can move it by breathing, and by moving your body. Just take a few purposeful steps, or use your hands. If you don’t naturally talk with your hands, think about using your hands to serve up your words and help them get out into your audience. Your palms are open and up and your gestures are flowing out toward your audience. This will make you look open and comfortable.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="139"><p data-reactid="140">Create good content.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="141"><p data-reactid="142">I work with investment bankers and CEO’s who make pitches with densely packed slides full of financial information or technical details. They rarely make for good storytelling. One of the biggest challenges they face when they start to present is that they have to work against their slides. They can’t not have the detail in there, but when they try to talk their way through it, the slides are a distraction.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="143"><p data-reactid="144">The solution is to eliminate everything you possibly can.

If you’re making a financial presentation and you’re nervous, your audience might read it as if you’re trying to cover something up.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="187"><p data-reactid="188">Manage yourself when you’re on.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="189"><p data-reactid="190">Now that you’re presenting, manage yourself in the moment. Here’s how:</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="191"><p data-reactid="192">Believe in yourself.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="193"><p data-reactid="194">Feel yourself. Use your instrument. Keep your energy moving.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="195"><p data-reactid="196">Relax</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="197"><p data-reactid="198">You can push on a wall, like Yul Brenner used to do before going onstage. Pushing on a wall tenses and relaxes your muscles.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="199"><p data-reactid="200">Smile and have fun.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="201"><p data-reactid="202">Smiling will relax you and relax your audience. This isn’t brain surgery. Nobody’s died (unless they have). Unless you’re delivering bad news, it’s okay to smile.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="203"><p data-reactid="204">In my experience, women tend to smile too much and men tend not to smile enough. You can be chatting with a guy and he’s friendly and lively, but as soon as he stands up to present, he’s grim and serious. Don’t be.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="205"><p data-reactid="206">For women, I think they tend to overdo smiles as a way of taking the edge off. If they’re too serious, they may be viewed as too masculine. There’s a balance. So be careful not to smile nervously, but a sincere smile always works.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="207"><p data-reactid="208">Focus on your audience.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="209"><p data-reactid="210">The reason you feel nervous when you stand up to present is because you’re self-conscious. You are literally focusing on yourself. You’re worried about embarrassing yourself, of screwing up, forgetting your lines, wondering if your zipper is open.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="211"><p data-reactid="212">The solution is simple: get your attention outside of yourself. Look at your audience. Really look. Make eye contact. You should always feel like you’re actually talking to someone, one person, no matter how many people are in your audience. When you make eye contact with someone, really feel that you’re making contact. You’re having a real conversation with one person, even if there are five hundred people in the audience (you might have to use your imagination).</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="213"><p data-reactid="214">Be yourself. Only better.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="215"><p data-reactid="216">But never be afraid to be yourself. Just be your best self.</p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="217"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="218"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="219"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="220"><span data-reactid="221"><!-- react-empty: 222 --><h2 data-reactid="223"><a data-reactid="224">futurosity</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="225"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="226"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="227"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="228"></div></section></div></div>
