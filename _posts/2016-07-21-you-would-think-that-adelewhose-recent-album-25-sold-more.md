You would think that Adele---whose recent album, 25, sold more than 3 million copies in the U.S. in its debut week---wouldn't have any problems with nerves before she performs.

You'd be wrong.

In an interview, Adele explained what she typically does before going onstage: "I puke quite a lot."

It's natural to be nervous when you give a presentation. I've been giving presentations for over twenty years and I'm still nervous for about the first thirty seconds every time I stand up in front of an audience.

Is presenting like jumping out of an airplane or like ballroom dancing?

There's a fascinating study that was done. Researchers took people who had never parachuted before and took measurements of their cortisol levels (a measure of stress) before and after they jumped. Before they jumped, their cortisol levels were raised to an extremely high level. After the jumped, the researchers measured again. And made the subjects jump again. After the second jump, their cortisol levels were half of what they were the first time. The researchers measured again. And made the subjects jump again. After the third jump, the cortisol levels dropped in half again.
